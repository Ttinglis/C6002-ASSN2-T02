## Wednesday 6th.
Our group together sketched up wireframes for the completed project to be drawn up by Olena in draw.io an online tool that can be shared and edited by all if we have any issues or changes we'd like to make. This is iintergrated with google docs and can be exported as an image file to be submitted in our main markdown report.
